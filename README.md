# NAME COMPARISON PROGRAM
### What it is
- This is a name comparison generator.
- It takes two names as input and uses an algorithm to
generate a compatibility score

- Shoutout to K, I saw it being done on her status.
### Technologies
~~This program is implemented in the C language.~~

This program is implemented with html,JavaScript and maybe CSS.

### How it Works
1. Two names are taken as input from the user.
2. All unique characters from the two names are counted
3. The count for each unique character is stored.
4. The first count and the last count are added until only two numbers remain
5. This remainder is the compatibility percentage!
